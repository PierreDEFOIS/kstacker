# To compute the flux at a given position, the optimize step can use 2 methods:
# - "aperture" uses an exact computation, from photutils. More precise but much
#   slower. This method is always used in the gradient reoptimization step.
# - "convolve" uses images that have been upsampled (factor 5 below) and
#   convolved with an aperture mask.
